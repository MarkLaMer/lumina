| 11  | **Gatekeeper's Sigil**: Create a gate between two flat surfaces that you can see. The gates close if you pass through or break line of sight.                                                                                                                  |
| 12  | **Pierced Heart**: State an object you desire. The heart indicates its direction and vague distance.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13  | **Pale Flame**: An object you touch glows with white light. Contact with the glowing object causes a chilling pain. The effect wears off when the Artifact is used again.                                                                                      |
| 14  | **Soul Chain**: Target must pass a DEX Danger Roll to avoid your touch, or they lose d6 WIL and you get a glimpse of their current desire.                                                                                                                     |
| 15  | **Foul Censer**: Green smoke surrounds you and everyone [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Near]]. Missiles (ranged attacks) cannot pass through the smoke.                                                                                                                           |
| 16  | **Pain Idol**: Roll a die of your choice. If the result is odd, you lose that much STR, if it's even your target loses that much STR.                                                                                                                          |
| 21  | **Bleeding Stave**: Spews blood-like oil onto an area. Anyone moving or standing [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Close]] must make a DEX Save to avoid falling and being unable to move on their turn. Disappears in a harmless flash if ignited.                                  |
| 22  | **Black Veil**: Target must pass a WIL Save or is blinded until you lift the curse or they Rest. Blinded individuals may require a DEX Save to carry out other actions that rely on sight, and their attacks are Impaired.                                     |
| 23  | **Webbed Hands**: Climb sheer surfaces as if you were a spider.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 24  | **Sun-blessed Bands**: Glow and hum lightly. Anybody attacking you suffers Damage equal to that they cause to you. If you attack a target yourself then the effect ends until you Rest.                                                                        |
| 25  | **Tyrant's Rod**: Order a target to drop, fall, flee or halt unless they pass a WIL Danger Roll.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 26  | **Flesh-Tome of Babble**: Speak in a strange sounding language. Every living thing is able to understand and reply in the same tongue if they wish.                                                                                                            |
| 31  | **Skull Magnet**: You may attract or repel a single target that has a boney skull, unless they pass a WIL Danger Roll.                                                                                                                                         |
| 32  | **Dopple-helm**: A perfect duplicate of you is formed. It acts independently, and just like the original. It cannot interact physically with anything. The double lasts until dismissed or a new double is created.                                            |
| 33  | **Gorger's Mask**: The wearer can consume anything safely.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34  | **Tomb Box**: Contains three tiny skeletons that obey whoever holds the box. They are too small to do any real damage, but are quite agile and clever.                                                                                                         |
| 35  | **Howling Lantern**: Blowing into the lantern causes a roar that terrifies prey animals, but attracts predators.                                                                                                                                               |
| 36  | **Peashooter**: This pocket gun ($d6$) can fire a beam of harmless light in any colour the wielder wishes.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 41  | **Fool's Coin**: Anybody that values money will crave this coin the first time they see it. The effect wears off after an hour.                                                                                                                                |
| 42  | **Strands of Suffering**: Strands spread between two [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Near]] surfaces. Those within only move very slowly and painfully unless they pass a DEX Danger Roll.                                                                                         |
| 43  | **Heat Ray Gun**: One metal object becomes too hot to touch. If it cannot be quickly dropped or removed, the wielder suffers $d8$ Damage, ignoring armour.                                                                                                     |
| 44  | **Warp Coil**: Touch an object to shrink it into a tiny miniature. Restore the object to original size at will. The original object can be up to your size, but living beings must be willing.                                                                 |
| 45  | **Frozen Cloud**: Floats at your will. Anybody within takes $d6$ Damage and cannot move unless they pass a STR Danger Roll.                                                                                                                                    |

| 51  | **Moon Lens**: Look at two objects and ask a question. The lens highlights the one object that best answers the question. It cannot predict the future.                                                                                                        |
| 52  | **Gavel of the Unbreakable Seal**: One door, window, etc. is sealed until you open it.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 54  | **Winter's Sickle**: Anybody taking Damage from this Sickle ($d6$) is Deprived and feels cold to their bones until they spend at least an hour warming themselves by a fire or other heat source.                                                              |
| 55  | **Hawk of Prosperity**: A mechanical bird ($3$ HP, $d6$ claws) that will only help you to accumulate wealth. Requires a coin each day as food.                                                                                                                 |
| 56  | **Inquisitor's Hood**: Speak a question with two possible answers. The target must pass a WIL Danger Roll or answer as honestly as they can. If they pass their Danger Roll, you blurt out an inconvenient truth.                                              |
| 61  | **Grief Cup**: Anybody drinking from this cup has upsetting visions showing the consequences of their past actions.                                                                                                                                            |
| 62  | **Victory Globe**: Swear an oath aloud. The globe gently guides you in the direction that would help you achieve the oath, but if you fail to complete it before the end of the day, it lashes your mind for $d12$ WIL loss.                                   |
| 63  | **False Platter**: Anybody viewing this platter sees an illusion of luxury that they are craving right now.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 64  | **Chance Rose**: Crush this ceramic rose to change the odds of success for a single action to 50%. This cannot make the impossible possible. The rose reforms at the start of each day.                                                                        |
| 65  | **Blue Iron Deathray**: This heavy weapon ($d10$ Damage, cannot move and fire) fires a beam of whistling blue light in place of a shot. It ignores armour and anyone taking Critical Damage explodes in blue fire. Anyone caught in the Blast takes d6 damage. |
| 66  | **Gold Visor**: While wearing this, you visualize a general sense of somebody's honesty and sincerity while they speak.                                                                                                                                        |
## Using an Artifact
A character can use an Artifact's power as a normal action. However, some Artifacts demand for something in return.

Artifacts are the most highly sought-after items in the world. Characters that are open about the Artifacts they carry are targeted by collectors and charlatans.

If a character starts with an Artifact, roll $d66$ to see which one they get:


# Greater Artifacts
Artifacts are usually classified according to one of the following categories:
- **[[Armour and shields\|Armour and shields]]:** Grant protective benefits to the user.
- **[[Treasures/Artifacts/Wizardly Items\|Wizardly Items]]:** Magical lengths of wood, metal, crystal, etc. Used by spell casters to unleash magical effects.
- **[[Treasures/Artifacts/Magitech\|Magitech]]**: Once the technology of a higher civilization in its golden age, now a unknown-working piece of magic.
- **[[Treasures/Artifacts/Magic Swords\|Magic Swords]]:** Grant bonuses to damage in combat. May also be enchanted with additional powers.

## Identifying Artifacts
When a characters first picks up an Artifact they sense its nature, but not its specific power. They must pass a WIL Danger Roll to understand its power before using it, otherwise just try the thing out and see what happens!
