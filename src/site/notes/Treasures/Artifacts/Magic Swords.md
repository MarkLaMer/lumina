Magic swords are exceptionally powerful and perilous artifacts. Each of these sentient weapons can only be wielded by [[Classes/Fighter\|Fighters]], and they take a sinister delight in the pain it inflicts upon others.

# Magic Sword Roleplay
A magic sword can talk to its wielder through telepathy. The GM can do it but if the table agrees, a player can play the role of another’s weapon. Players cannot “act” with the weapon in any way, but they can speak to the wielder now and then. The goal is to make sure the weapon has a personality that contributes to the story, not to make your friends’ lives miserable.

The sword personality will be different depending on the wielding Fighter’s highest attribute:
- STR (brutal, always calling for action)
- DEX (vicious, often mocking the wielder)
- WIL (judgmental, prideful, pushing the wielder to be more ambitious)

# Creating a Magic Sword
Each runic weapon possesses its own Willpower score, determined using the same method applied to [[Characters/Creating a Character\|Creating a Character]]. 
>[!Warning]
>At the beginning of each session, the GM must perform a WIL Danger Roll for the weapon. If this test succeeds, the weapon will seize the opportunity to kill its wielder if they ever become helpless during that session. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, the weapon may choose to take the life of an important NPC instead.
