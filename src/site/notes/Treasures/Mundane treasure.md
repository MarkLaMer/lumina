Mundane treasure are items that are not magical in nature.

## Luxurious Items
Adventures may also include valuable items of other kinds, whose worth may not always be obvious:

- **Artwork:** Paintings, statuary.
- **Books:** Rare tomes or scrolls.
- **Foodstuffs:** Spices, valuable wines.
- **Furnishings:** Rugs, tapestries.
- **Utensils:** Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements.
- **Valuables:** Furs, ivory, ores, silks.

## Gemstones
Gems are very valuable and easier to transport than that statue of the frog god in the dungeon or a chest of coins, making them one of the most appealing kinds of treasure.
