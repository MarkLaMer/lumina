### Power Attack
On your attack, you may choose to Power Attack. Roll 2 damage dice. The weapon breaks.
### Magic Swords
Delivering the killing blow with [[Treasures/Artifacts/Magic Swords\|Magic Swords]] transfers a non-violent supernatural ability that the monster has to the weapon. Once the blade bonds with the ability, it cannot absorb a new one.
>[!Example] Example: *Blade of the Basilisk*
>Absorbed Ability: Petrifying Gaze
> *The sword gains a reflective sheen. When the wielder brandishes the sword, a creature in sight must succeed a WIL Danger Roll or become petrified for a round.*
