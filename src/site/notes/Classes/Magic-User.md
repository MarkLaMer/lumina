![Pasted image 20250313115650.png|right lp|400](/img/user/zRSC/images/Pasted%20image%2020250313115650.png)*Sorcery is Chaos using humans as conduits and letting them think theyâ€™re in control. Of course, bending reality to your will has a price. One way or another, it's a quick and memorable life. The greybeard wizards are simply the ones who managed to survive for long enough or got caught with an aging curse. Magic-Users are those that have pursued the dark arts and are no longer welcome in society.*

### Magic
Magic is unknown, dangerous and inhuman. It is also rare. After years of training or some bounty grab involving the exchange of their soul, only magic-users can cast spells.
### Alchemy
As a Camp action, Magic-Users can [[Magic/Alchemy\|brew potions]] from potent ingredients found growing in the dungeon and in the bodies of beasts. 
### Magic Missiles
*[[Magic/Spells\|Spells]] are items of locked magical power. Magic-Users can ignore the conditions or effects to cast the Spell by simply using it to deal pure maleficence.* 
As an action, fill-in all usage points of a Spell to [[Playing the Game/Combat#Attacks\|Attack]] with d6 [[Playing the Game/Combat#Blast\|Blast]] damage to anyone within a [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Close]] radius of where the magic missile hits. 
### With a Bang
Magic-users don't die like regular chums. Every one dies in a [[Playing the Game/Scars, Mutation and Death\|unique way]].

| **Whispering Tongues**: Learn how to read one of the following languages: Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, Primordial, Sylvan, Umbracant (see [[zRSC/GM Archive/Monsters/Languages\|Language]]). Selecting the same language again allows the Magic-User to speak that language as well. |
| **Detect Magic**: Detect the nature of a unknown magic item before use with a WIL Danger Roll   under a cup (once per object). Failing to detect may indicate a misidentification of the item. Only the GM may see the roll result until the item is first used.     |

| **Spell Eater**: Roll WIL to absorb a spell cast in your general direction into a spent [[Magic/Spells\|Spell Tablet]]. Fill its usage.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Ability Score Increase**: +2 to Dexterity or Willpower Score. An Ability cannot exceed 18!                                                                                                                                                                         |
