# Oops!
Sometimes spells backfire and miscast! Chaos bursts forth! No one said magic was care-free or simple.

Whenever one or more 6s are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes d6 damage to WIL for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL Danger Roll. If failed, take the Mad condition.

The spell’s miscast effect is determined by changing a few letters of the spell's name. The magic-user’s player and at least one other non-referee player suggest alternatives of the spell, changing a few letters from the original spelling. The referee picks from the alternatives suggested and describes how this magic effect is realized in the situation.

>[!Example]
>**Heal → Heel:**  
>The magic-user intended to close wounds but instead transformed the target's foot, enlarging and strengthening their heel disproportionately.
>
>**Skybolt → Shybolt:**  
>The spellcaster intended to call lightning from the heavens but instead produced an anxious spark that timidly fizzled out midair.
>
>**Ghost Hog → Ghost Hug:**  
>Instead of conjuring an ethereal pig companion, the caster summons a warm yet intangible embrace that leaves everyone feeling deeply melancholic.
>
>**Fireball → Firefall**. The magic-user attempted to catapult a massive ball of fire towards an enemy but instead made it rain fire.

## Mutation
If no one can think of an alternative, the failed magic-user will roll the table below, becoming more draconic and wild.
