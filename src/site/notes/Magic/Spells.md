*Spells are living spirits trapped by runes carved on obsidian tablets. Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The [[Magic/Creating Spells\|creation of spells]] is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards.*
>[!Tip] Designer's Note
>Be creative. Magic allows for a variety of solutions. Sometimes simple damage is less effective than illusions or pure wickedness.

# Spellcasting Rules
Casting spells takes one action if cast during combat. The GM is the final arbiter of how the spell manifests and how it affects the situation.

To cast a spell, you must hold the spell tablet in one hand and read it aloud. Casting a spell is super obvious. When casting a spell, decide the **Power** to cast it with, up to the number of usage dots remaining on the spell. Roll a number of d6 equal to the power the spell is cast with. For each die of value 4-6, mark one usage on the spell.

The spell has an effect, which varies on the number of [DICE] invested, and the [SUM] of the dice results and the level "[L]" of the caster. 

## Recharging a spell
When a spell’s usage dots are filled, it is depleted and cannot be cast. Each spell has a recharge condition. Fulfilling this condition will coax the spirit back to the spell and clear all of its usage dots. 

## Miscasts 
Whenever one or more 6s are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes d6 damage to WIL for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL Danger Roll. 

If failed, take the Mad condition and figure out with the players what [[Magic/Miscasts\|Miscast]] actually does.

## Iron resists magic
*That is because iron is the bones of the plane of Flesh.*

Spells cast on iron objects fail. 
Spells aimed at targets carrying significant amount of iron also fail.
You cannot cast a spell if you are carrying a significant amount of iron or steel.
