*Spells are living spirits trapped by runes carved on obsidian tablets. Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The [[Magic/Creating Spells\|creation of spells]] is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards.*
>[!Tip] Designer's Note
>Be creative. Magic allows for a variety of solutions. Sometimes simple damage is less effective than illusions or pure wickedness.

# Spellcasting Rules
Casting spells takes one action if cast during combat. The GM is the final arbiter of how the spell manifests and how it affects the situation.

To cast a spell, you must hold the spell tablet in one hand and read it aloud. Casting a spell is super obvious. 

1. Add a [[Playing the Game/Conditions\|Exhausted condition]] to inventory, occupying one slot.
2. Decide the **Power** to cast it with, up to the number of usage dots remaining on the spell. 
3. Roll a number of d6 equal to the power the spell is cast with. The spell has an effect, which varies on the number of [DICE] invested, and the [SUM] of the dice results and the level "[L]" of the caster. 

## Miscasts 
Whenever one or more 6s are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes d6 damage to WIL for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL Danger Roll. 

If failed, take the Mad condition and figure out with the players what [[Magic/Miscasts\|Miscast]] actually does.

## You find a Spell!
Roll on this table of spells as loot, or use these spells as examples for [[Magic/Creating Spells\|creating your own]].
