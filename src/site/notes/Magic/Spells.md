*Spells are living spirits trapped by runes carved on obsidian tablets. Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The [[Magic/Creating Spells\|creation of spells]] is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards.*
>[!Tip] Designer's Note
>Be creative. Magic allows for a variety of solutions. Sometimes simple damage is less effective than illusions or pure wickedness.

# Spellcasting Rules
Casting spells takes one action if cast during combat. The GM is the final arbiter of how the spell manifests and how it affects the situation.

To cast a spell, you must hold the spell tablet in one hand and read it aloud. Casting a spell is super obvious. When casting a spell, decide the **Power** to cast it with: roll a number of d6s equal to the power the spell is cast (between 1 and 3).

For each die of value 4-6, mark one usage on the spell in the SLOT. Spells also have 3 usage points. The spell has an effect, which varies on the number of [DICE] invested, and the [SUM] of the dice results. 

## Iron resists magic
*That is because iron is the bones of the plane of Flesh.*

Spells cast on iron objects fail. 
Spells aimed at targets carrying significant amount of iron also fail.
You cannot cast a spell if you are carrying a significant amount of iron or steel.
