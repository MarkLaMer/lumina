# Reagents
Those strange creatures lurking in the dungeon are alchemically potent. Their guts are, anyway.

[[Classes/Magic-User\|Magic-Users]] (and [[Classes/Specialist\|Specialists]] with a Hunter's Mark on a creature) know which viscera have alchemical properties and can spend a Turn to harvest these reagents

> When you harvest a reagent and store it, write down the reagent and the creature it was harvested from.
> E.g., Eyes of salamander, Toes of dire bat, Tongue of hellhound.

Usually, any given creature can only produce **ONE** viable reagent. Huge monsters *might* produce several.

>[!Note] 
>Sentient humanoids like humans, orcs, goblins, fey, etc., never provide reagents. Monsters without gets (e.g., wraiths) also do not provide reagents as they have no guts.
>It must be monstrous!
# Alchemy
Using Alchemy Tools (see [[Equipment & Services/Equipment Details\|Equipment Details]]), a [[Classes/Magic-User\|Magic-User]] can brew alchemical substances as a Camp action. 
- Transform as many reagents at the same time as you want. Each becomes an alchemical substance.
- You choose how to transform these alchemical substances (i.e., bomb, potion, or oil).
## Alchemical Substances
### Bomb
Throw it and create an area effect.
>E.g. Throw a bomb to poison a foe with spider venom.
### Potion
Affect the drinker.
>E.g. Drink a potion to gain a giant spider's wall climbing ability.
### Oil
Smear on surfaces to do different things.
>E.g. Distill spider webbing into a glue-like oil that bonds with whatever it touches.
