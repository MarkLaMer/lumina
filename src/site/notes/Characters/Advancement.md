![Pasted image 20250313115940.png|right lp|400](/img/user/zRSC/images/Pasted%20image%2020250313115940.png)All characters who survive an adventure and return to civilization gain 1 experience point (XP) for each coin (c) worth of ***non-magic treasure*** recovered from remote, dangerous locations like dungeons. Treasure is evenly split evenly between all PCs who assisted and converted into XP (alternatively, see [[Playing the Game/Downtime#XP and Carousing\|Carousing]]). 

> [!Note] Converting Wealth
> Coins are the universal silver currency of civilization (10 coins is the wage for a day unskilled labour). If you are using a pre-made dungeon from another RPG that uses copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum coins, then convert the total to gold coins and gain that much XP.

# Levelling Up
Each time a character reaches the necessary XP threshold, the character will advance a level. Each level unlocks the Special feature and also allows the player to reroll their PCâ€™s HP maximum using one additional d6.  If the rolled total is not greater than their last maximum, add 1 to the last maximum. XP does not reset.
