#Characters 
Bonds are a source of roleplay between characters and a main source of meta currency. Bonds are formed between player characters. They are recorded with simple sentences. Your Bonds become charged when *you play them to the hilt* or *when they put you in danger*.

Bonds with other players may be charged to heal [[Playing the Game/Conditions\|Conditions]]. For each charge you burn, you heal 1 [[Playing the Game/Conditions\|Condition]].
