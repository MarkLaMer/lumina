To create a character, you’ll first need a [character sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wec6VdSv-QKD93J8UrMkgssnu6l0cmcS/view?usp=sharing)—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character. All new delvers start at level 1 with 0 XP. 
# Ability Scores
Every delver has three [[Characters/Ability Scores\|Ability Scores]]: Strength, Dexterity and Willpower. These measure their basic strengths and weaknesses. 
- **STR**: physical strength and resilience. 
- **DEX**: speed and agility. 
- **WIL**: mental will and charisma
>[!Summary] Step 1
>For each of these abilities, in order, roll 3d6. Write down the result in your Ability Score 'max'.
# Choose a Class
There are three [[Classes/Classes\|Classes]] to play that help define your role in the company: [[Classes/Fighter\|Fighter]], [[Classes/Magic-User\|Magic-User]] and [[Classes/Specialist\|Specialist]]. Your class will determine what dice to roll for HP, what kinds of weapons you are trained in and what special abilities you will gain.

[[Playing the Game/Combat#Hit Protection ("HP") and Damage\|HP]] is how much damage your delver can shrug off before taking serious harm.

>[!Summary] Step 2
>- Choose a [[Classes/Classes\|Class]].
>- Roll for [[Playing the Game/Combat#Hit Protection ("HP") and Damage\|HP]] based on your Class.
>- Write down your Class Starting Perks.
# Roll for Coin, get a Failed Career
Coins are the basic silver currency of the realm. What is the main reason you adventure? Crippling debt. Your group of adventurers are $10,000$ coins in [[Equipment & Services/Adventurer's Guild#Company Debt\|debt]].
How did you get there? You screwed up your last job!
>[!Summary] Step 3
>- Roll $d6 \times 10$ for your delver's starting coin. 
>- Based on your HP and Coin, figure out your past [[Characters/Failed Career\|Failed Career]].
# Starting equipment
Your delver carries items in [[Equipment & Services/Inventory\|Inventory]] slots. Most items take up one inventory slot. Some larger items, such as two-handed weapons and armour take up two slots. This isn't Skyrim or Minecraft where you can carry a near-infinite amount of material with you!
>[!Summary] Step 4
>Your delver starts with:
>- **Torches**
>- **Rations**
>- Two items from their **[[Characters/Failed Career\|Failed Career]]**
>- A **[[Equipment & Services/Equipment Details\|weapon]]** of your choice
>- [[Equipment & Services/Equipment Details\|Anything else]] you buy with your starting coin.
>
>>If your delver’s highest Ability Score is 9 or less, your character starts off with an [[Treasures/Artifacts/Artifacts\|Artifact]].

# Details
>[!Summary] Step 5
>For the sake of fleshing out your character and roleplay, roll a [[Characters/Flesh Out your Character#Motto\|motto]], [[Characters/Flesh Out your Character#Physical Detail\|physical detail]], [[Characters/Flesh Out your Character#Reason Delving\|reason for delving]], [[Characters/Bonds\|bond]], and a [[Characters/Flesh Out your Character#Name\|name]].

# Finished Everything?
- **Create Your Company of Delvers**: Name your group, and you (or the GM) will determine your starting settlement and base of operations. Agree to the [[Equipment & Services/Adventurer's Guild\|Adventurer's Guild]] terms of employment.
- **Level 1**: As a fresh and shiny delver, you start at [[Characters/Advancement\|level 1]]. Write down your title of "Greenhorn" on your character sheet until the next glorious level-up!
- **Repeat** and make a backup character :)
