*A very real prospect in any Delver's line of work.*

If a Delver's STR is down to 0 (or less), roll a d6 inside a opaque cup. There is a 3-in-6 chance of surviving. Do not look at the result until a comrade "checks" your vitals. 

# My character died. Now what?
*Skill issue.* Roll up a new [[Characters/Creating a Character\|level 1 character]] and the GM will reintroduce you into the next scene (GM disc.). You may also take the role of one of your henchmen, upgrading the NPC to PC status.
## Body Recovery
If the company can recover the body of a dead PC (use 1 hand and 1 body [[Characters/Creating a Character#Inventory\|slot]] to carry), for the cost of 25% increase in company [[Equipment & Services/Adventurer's Guild#Company Debt\|debt]], the Guild's masterful sorcerers may bring back the dead comrade to life, though not quite the same. 

A revived character must roll for a [[Magic/Spells#Mutation\|Mutation]].
# Inheritance
Faced with the possibility of character death, players may wish to create a will for their characters, to leave wealth behind for an heir. If the GM allows it, the following stipulations apply:
- **Tax:** Any treasure left as an inheritance will be taxed at 10%.
- **Heir:** The heir must be a newly created character of 1st level.
- **Once only:** Inheritance may only be left once by each player.
