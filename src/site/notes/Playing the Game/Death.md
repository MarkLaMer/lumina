*A very real prospect in any Delver's line of work.*

If a Delver's STR is down to 0 (or less), roll a d6 inside a opaque cup. There is a 3-in-6 chance of surviving. Do not look at the result until a comrade "checks" your vitals. 

# My character died. Now what?
*Skill issue.* As a player, you get to make a choice: Death or Debasement! 

## I Choose Death
Noble choice! Accept that your characters died, and you get a bonus for creating your [[Characters/Creating a Character\|new level 1 character]] and the GM will reintroduce you into the next scene (GM disc.). You may also take the role of one of your henchmen, upgrading the NPC to PC status. 
>Choose a boon:
>- Roll $2d6+6$ for your Ability Scores.
>- Roll $2d$ for HP.

## My character is too young to die! Debasement!
Faith smiles on your character but not too kindly. 
> Reroll your Ability Scores (3d6) and take the lower result between your score max vs what you rolled. 
> Roll on the mutations table.

# Inheritance
Faced with the possibility of character death, players may wish to create a will for their characters, to leave wealth behind for an heir. If the GM allows it, the following stipulations apply:
- **Tax:** Any treasure left as an inheritance will be taxed at 10%.
- **Heir:** The heir must be a newly created character of 1st level.
- **Once only:** Inheritance may only be left once by each player.
