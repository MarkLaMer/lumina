The town is a "safe zone," so character groups can never attack or kill each other there. 
# Rest
All time in game is treated the same as time in the real world. See [[Playing the Game/Delving Rules#Time\|the rules on Time]].
### Short Rest
A few minutes of rest and a swig of water or a ration heals all of a character's lost HP. Resting may waste time or attract danger.
### Long Rest
Takes 1 hour. A meal and some sleep will restore all HP. If HP was already full, restore 1d6 to an ability score.
### Full Rest
A full week back in safety fully restores your delver's ability scores and removes most long-term [[Playing the Game/Conditions\|Conditions]].

# Costs of Living 
Use the following table when determining a PC’s lifestyle between adventures. A social level’s monthly cost of living is also a good guideline for bribes and gifts for someone of that class
# XP and Carousing
Gain **1 XP for every coin's worth extracted from the delve**. 

Characters can gamble their downtime engaged in indulging activities such as attending parties, excessively singing and drinking, seeking companionship or other flavourful ideas the players come up with. 

Carousing takes a whole night and costs 
- d6x100c in Impoverished establishments, 
- d10x100c in towns and 
- d20x100c in cities. 
 
Players must roll to see how many coins they gambled away. The PC with the highest roll determines the amount of XP everyone participating gains individually. The PC with the highest roll, additionally, will roll on the Carousing mishap table for going too wild. 
>[!Warning] Overspending
>If you did not have enough coins to carouse away as you did, the difference is added to your character's debt.
