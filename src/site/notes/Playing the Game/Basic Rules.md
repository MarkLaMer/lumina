# Turns
A turn is the moment when the GM asks you, "it's your turn, what do you do?" The turn is is the metronome of the delving tune, and each beat can represent a different passage of time. In game time, a turn may represent a few moments (~10 seconds) in combat, a few minutes (~10 minutes)  while delving, a few hours (~4 hours) while on a watch in the wilderness or travelling to another location. Regardless, the game is always played in turns. 

Your turn consists of ONE of the following:
- an Action
- a movement to something [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Near]] and an Action
- a movement to something [[Playing the Game/Distance\|Far]] away. 
>[!Note] 
>Generally, PCs take their turn before any enemy. If there is a risk of the characters being surprised, the PCs must each roll a DEX Danger Roll or be unable to act on the first turn. In combat, the combatants with the longest weapons act first.
# Actions
Actions are very organic. Imagine as if you're playing a rogue-lite in analogue. For risky actions, the GM may call for the character at risk to roll a [[Playing the Game/Basic Rules#Danger Rolls\|Danger Rolls]]. For example, attempting to trip an opponent might force a STR Danger Roll to remain standing.
### Examples of actions that take a turn:
- Attacking with a sword in combat.
- Pick a lock or disarm a trap in a delve.
- Search a room carefully or looting in a delve.
- Jury-rig something or work a complex device in a delve.
- Have an extended parley with the dungeon inhabitants.
>[!Tip] Designer's Note 
>Why no bonus actions? Reactions? My guaranteed second attack roll!? 
>Allowing a limited number of actions will force players to weigh and prioritize what their character needs to do as time and resources deplete.
# Danger Rolls
A Danger Roll is a roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation. Roll a d20 equal to or below the relevant Ability Score. Failure means negative consequences, not always a failed action. 
### How do you defy danger? 
- By powering through or intimidation? = **Strength**
- Through agility and finesse? = **Dexterity**
- Through resilience or force of personality? = **Willpower**
### Interpreting Results
• **Hit**!: The roll under your Ability Score.
• **Miss**!: Beyond your ability! The roll too high over the Ability Score! 
>[!Check] Optional Rule - Crit
>When a player rolls a natural 20 on a Danger Roll, the result CRITS! The Ability Score that was used automatically increases its maximum by 1.
## Easy & Hard Rolls
Roll 2d20, take the better /worser result respectively. Hard rolls when attacking enemies
in cover, or low visibility. Tasks relating to your PC’s [[Characters/Failed Career\|Failed Career]] are Easy.
## Versus Rolls
When two foes are vying for the same goal, the GM may call for each to roll a Danger Roll. The character that rolls higher while also under their Ability Score succeeds. Example versus rolls might be resolving a quick chase (DEX versus), holding back/forcing open a door (STR versus), meddling with the mind of another (WIL versus), etc.

>[!Tip] No Social Rolls! 
>The outcome of social interactions can be resolved with common sense and roleplaying. All NPCs have a ***need***, ***motivation***, and ***disposition*** to the PCs' company. If the PCs can find a way to satisfy the NPCs' need, motivate using arguments through roleplay, they may improve the NPCs' disposition towards them and be persuaded.

>[!Tip] Recalling Lore
>PCs automatically know all common knowledge and any specialized knowledge covered by their careers. Any other knowledge must be discovered in-game.

>[!Tip] Search Rolls?
>Hidden things are either automatically discovered after enough time is spent searching (usually a full Turn for dungeon rooms or a full Watch for wilderness hexes) or they cannot be found without taking in-game actions. Obvious features of an area should be described right away to PCs, and other details should be described as players ask questions and investigate.
