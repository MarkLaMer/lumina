All [[Equipment & Services/Equipment Details\|equipment]] and conditions are stored in one of ten Inventory slots: a *backpack* with six slots, one slot for each hand and two slots for the upper body (belt, chest, etc.).
- **Hand Slots**: Carried items you are currently using.
- **Body Slots**: Worn items can be swapped with hand slots as a free action
- **Pack Slots**: Items in these slots take time to retrieve when under pressure. While in [[Playing the Game/Combat\|Combat]], your delver must use an action (instead of attacking) to find an item in a pack.

*Bulky* items take up two slots and are typically two handed. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is *encumbered* and reduced to 0 HP.

# Conditions
[[Playing the Game/Conditions\|Conditions]] are negative effects on your delver. Conditions must be placed in an inventory slot. Some also have additional effects. Conditions can only be removed from your delver’s inventory by meeting their clear condition — usually a long or full rest or by activating a [[Characters/Bonds\|Bond]].
# Usage
All items have three usage dots (except for Heavy Armour which has 6, and [[Magic/Spells\|Spells]] and [[Treasures/Artifacts/Magic Swords\|Magic Swords]] which do not mark usage). When all three dots are marked on an item, it is depleted or destroyed. 
- **Weapons/armour/ammunition**: after a fight, roll d6 for each item that was used during the fight. On 4-6, mark usage. 
- **Torches/lanterns**: mark usage every hour (see [[Playing the Game/Delving Rules#Light\|Light Rules]]). 
- **Rations**: mark usage after a meal. 
- **Other gear**: if used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage
>[!Note]
>Usage dots can be cleared from weapons/armour for 1% of the original [[zRSC/GM Archive/Playtest for later/Equipment Details Pictures\|upkeep level]] cost per dot cleared.
