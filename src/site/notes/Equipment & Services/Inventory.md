# Conditions
Conditions are negative effects on your delver. Conditions must be placed in an inventory slot. Some also have additional effects. Conditions can only be removed from your delver’s inventory by meeting their clear condition —usually a long or full rest
# Usage
Most items have three usage dots. When all three dots are marked on an item, it is depleted or destroyed. Usage dots can be cleared from weapons/armour for 1% of the original [[Equipment & Services/Equipment Details Pictures\|upkeep level]]cost per dot cleared. 
- **Weapons/armour/ammunition**: after a fight, roll d6 for each item that was used during the fight. On 4-6, mark usage. 
- **Torches/lanterns**: mark usage every hour (see [[Playing the Game/Delving Rules#Light\|Light Rules]]). 
- **Rations**: mark usage after a meal. 
- **Other gear**: if used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage
# Encumbrance
If supposedly your delver has no more storage locations (even with a sack), you can store items in no slot. 
While encumbered, your delver cannot run, all [[Playing the Game/Basic Rules#Danger Rolls\|Danger Rolls]] are [[Playing the Game/Basic Rules#Easy & Hard Rolls\|Hard]] and he/she is reduced to 0 **HP**.
